st.caption('A fire detection system is a crucial component of any building\'s safety infrastructure. Its primary purpose is to detect the presence of fire or smoke in a facility and alert the occupants and emergency response teams to take appropriate actions. Modern fire detection systems typically consist of various interconnected devices that work together to monitor and detect potential fire hazards.')
st.caption('Fire detection systems using deep learning leverage the power of artificial intelligence to identify and detect fire incidents with increased accuracy and efficiency. These systems utilize deep learning algorithms, which are a subset of machine learning algorithms that can automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.')
